# Mother3VF

[ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· En franÃ§ais](README.md)

This repository contains all the sources for the Mother 3 French fan translation project, along with tools we used during this project. Some files come from [the tools that were provided by the English fan translation 1.2](http://mother3.fobby.net/tools), and we have edited them for our own needs in a few instances.

Here youâ€™ll find:
* the French text in its entirety
* our translated graphics
* our bitmap fonts
* our tilemaps and arrangements for graphics
* the translated audio clips
* our GBA ASM THUMB assembly routines, and those provided by the English team and contributors
* our data tables, and a few routines in the internal Game Logic language
* preview and editing tools, text/audio conversion tools, assembly and ROM building tools

Compared to the tools provided by Tomatoâ€™s team, here you may find more graphical elements (especially those which were already in English in the Japanese version and that the English team didnâ€™t need to translate), newer hacking routines (at least compared to the English 1.2, things may be subject to change), and, obviously, our French text.

Weâ€™ve been working on these files since 2015, but theyâ€™ve only been deployed to GitHub in 2021. Which means youâ€™ll only have access of a small part of the entire history of the project.

Feel free to clone the project and edit anything you want. To edit the text files, use a text editor such as Notepad++. *script.txt* as well as files from *0-8E.txt* to *0-42.txt* must be saved using UTF-8 encoding, whereas all other text files must be saved using Windows-1252 encoding (please refer to the parameters in your text editor).
Your changes will then allow you to build a ROM adapted to your needs.

To achieve this, youâ€™ll need:
* an unmodified Japanese ROM of MOTHER 3
* a PC with Windows and the [.NET Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/dotnet/framework/install/on-windows-10) (youâ€™ll also need Python and Java to run some of the additional tools)

To generate the ROM:
* clone the repository (download the zip archive) to a local folder
* put the Japanese ROM in the same folder and rename it to *mother3_jp.gba*
* open TextInjector.exe, uncheck *Encode the script* in the *Encoding* menu, click *Load scriptâ€¦* and select *script.txt*. Then click *Dump to binfile* and keep the save file name as default
* run j.bat, ideally from the Windows command prompt (if youâ€™re familiar with it), or from Windows Explorer otherwise
* wait until the entire process is complete (approximately 30 seconds), and your translated ROM will then be generated as *mother3_fr.gba*
